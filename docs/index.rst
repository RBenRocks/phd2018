Aim
====
The aim of the course is to give students a fundamental understanding of:

1. how high-throughput omics data including proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and metagenomics data can be analysed
2. how mathematical modelling of biological systems can be used to gain novel biological insight through integration of multi-omics data.

A number of examples from analysis of data from different studies of mouse, rat and human tissues in different physiological conditions will be introduced. Students will further get hands-on experience with analysis of raw data from transcriptome, metabolome, metagenome data and will be introduced to how such data can be analysed using different statistical techniques. Methods for reconstruction of metabolic network models, analysis and use of these for simulation of biological functions in different cells/tissues will be presented. Finally, the students will learn about integrated data analysis through a number of different examples. The overall objective is that each PhD student attending this course should be able to work independently in the field of systems biology.

Course organization
===================
Guest lecturers will also attend the course. It will be a 4 days PhD course with lectures and workshops. There will be a mini symposium on one day where leaders in the field will have keynote lectures

Course Credits
==============
3 ECTS. Certificate will be given by the end of the course.
